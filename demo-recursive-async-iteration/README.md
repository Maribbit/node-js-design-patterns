# Recursive Asynchronous Iteration Pattern

This is an abstraction of the pattern used in simple-web-spider v2.
It only use callbacks to iterate over a collection while applying an asynchronous function.

`main.js` shows this pattern in the most simple term.
`general.js` is an exercise to build a generalized function in this pattern.
